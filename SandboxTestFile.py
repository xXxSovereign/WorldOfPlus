# THIS IS A FILE WHERE YOU CAN TEST ANYTHING YOU WANT. THIS WILL BE DELETED UPON RELEASE

# I.E. test any random thing here, an open area so you dont clutter your own files

test = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    [1, 2, "center", 4, 5],
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
]

print(test[2][2])  # should fetch the "center" at the direct center
